<h2>Remembering Mean Gene Okerlund</h2>

    It took just 36 hours of 2019 for the WWE Universe to be absolutely rocked by a huge loss. "Mean" Gene Okerlund passed away at 76 years old.

WWE interviewer 'Mean' Gene Okerlund, 76, dies
"Mean" Gene Okerlund, one of the voices synonymous with professional wrestling as a host, in-ring announcer and interviewer since the mid-1980s, has died at the age of 76.


Lapsed WWE fan's 2018 year in review
If you missed any chunk of 2018 as a fan of WWE (or just wish you did), not to worry -- Greg Wyshynski wraps up the highs and lows of the year that was in professional wrestling.

It's hard to quantify just how meaningful "Mean" Gene was to the glory days of '80s wrestling that took the pastime we love from a sideshow to a legit mainstream business, but he was surely integral.

When you step back and really look at the '80s, it's reasonable to argue that "Mean" Gene's name ranks fourth in wrestling's mainstream consciousness after Hulk Hogan, Andre the Giant and Randy Savage. Every American who grew up with a television in the mid-eighties is quick to drop a "Well, let me tell you something Mean Gene!" Hulk Hogan impression whenever pro wrestling is mentioned.

Ranking wrestlers' greatness can be challenging when you don't know who was really responsible for the character's creation. Did Hulk Hogan make Vince McMahon or did McMahon actually create Hogan? But Gene Okerlund was always Gene Okerlund.

Before coming to the WWE from the AWA with Hulk Hogan back in 1983, Okerlund had mastered his role as the straight man. He took his legitimate broadcast skills from local radio and used them to create the "character" that he played in professional wrestling. And one has to remember what Gene Okerlund's job actually was in order to truly appreciate his brilliance. Gene Okerlund was not an interviewer.

Gene Okerlund was playing an interviewer named "Mean" Gene Okerlund in the same way Hulk Hogan was playing a world champion in a competitive sport. He struck an absolutely perfect balance of seriousness, humor, energy, sarcasm and dry wit. He never tried to steal the spotlight, and as a result, the spotlight always seemed to find him. He knew how to handle an irate Bobby Heenan differently than an insane Randy Savage. He knew when the line of realism had been crossed and a very slight wink to the audience was needed. In his last real run with WCW, he knew how to play along with what had become the regular absurdity of a show that was entertaining but completely ridiculous. He knew how to do it all.

To a kid like me and so many more, Okerlund showed there was a way to participate in this world of giants even if you were just a mortal man. I by no means have and never will come near Gene's level of talent or success, but by attempting to be a radio host turned WWE personality, I have seen firsthand just how difficult it is to be credible and authentic as the person you are inside this colorful world known as WWE.

I saw Gene for the last time backstage at Raw 25. He was hanging out and looking as only he could look. I almost never take pictures backstage for obvious reasons, but it was a special night, and Gene was a special sighting. I went up to him and greeted him and quickly asked if we could take a picture. In our brief interaction he managed to completely represent everything I had ever seen and heard about him. He was straight, sarcastic and jokingly (I think) treated me like a total jabroni. His face in the photo completely encapsulates the energy he exuded -- "Who the hell is this guy?"

Just a fan taking a picture with a legend.
        "Mean" Gene Okerlund, the iconic WWE backstage interviewer who played a role in some of the biggest moments in pro wrestling history, died Wednesday, his family announced. He was 76.

Okerlund's son, Tor Okerlund, told The Associated Press that his father died early Wednesday at a hospital in Sarasota, Florida, near his home in Osprey, Florida, with his wife, Jeanne, by his side. Tor Okerlund said his father, who had received three kidney transplants, fell a few weeks ago "and it just kind of went from bad to worse.''

Okerlund stood next to Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, Randy "Macho Man" Savage, Andre the Giant, the Ultimate Warrior and many others from the mid- to late-1980s and teed up the stars of that era to deliver some of their most memorable promos. In the mid-1990s, Okerlund moved to rival WCW and stood in the ring as garbage rained down upon Hogan as he formed the nWo.

"A voice and soundtrack to an entire era of our industry. He was the star of some of WWE's most memorable segments," WWE executive vice president Paul "Triple H" Levesque said on Twitter on Wednesday. "'Mean Gene' was beloved by all who got to work with him. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time."

Wrestling stars, including Hogan, remembered Okerlund with posts on social media.

Okerlund returned to the WWE fold upon the closing of WCW in a variety of roles and appearances, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006, by Hogan.

Okerlund's last WWE appearance came on Jan. 22, 2018, when he appeared on the 25th anniversary of "Monday Night Raw" and interviewed then-WWE champion AJ Styles.

He started as an interviewer in the Minneapolis-based American Wrestling Association before moving to the WWE in 1984, where his duties included hosting "All-American Wrestling" and "Tuesday Night Titans" as well as serving as the lead locker room interviewer.

Jesse Ventura, who wrestled as "The Body" before he was elected governor in Minnesota, dubbed Okerlund with his "Mean Gene" nickname

Ventura told the Minneapolis Star Tribune on Wednesday that in an interview he "laughingly called him 'the Mean Gene Hot Air Machine,' and the 'Mean Gene' stuck.''

Ventura called Okerlund "the best at what he did, the best straight man interviewer in wrestling history.''

In a 2015 interview with the Star Tribune, Okerlund credited the late pro wrestling pioneer Verne Gagne for his start.

Okerlund worked in sales at the television station where Gagne's AWA was based and had experience in radio. Gagne approached Okerlund in the hallway when the regular interviewer could not make a taping in the early 1970s, Okerlund recalled.

"I said, 'Verne, I know zero about wrestling.' He said, 'Do you have a suit and tie? That's all you need.' There were a few bucks involved, so I dived in,'' Okerlund said.
