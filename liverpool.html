<h2>Liverpool v City: Random Thoughts</h2>
<img src = "../img/lfcmanc.jpg" width="500" alt="Bandersnatch cover">

    <p>
Three out of every four people who bet on Manchester City v Liverpool with Ladbrokes backed Liverpool. I can guess why. It was for reasons like these:

Liverpool had won their previous nine Premier League games. City had lost three times in December. Liverpool had not lost in the Premier League all season – that is to say, in 20 games.

It must have been easy for someone to convince themselves that Liverpool were better than City and should win wherever they played. There seemed to be powerful arguments for backing Liverpool. Any argument for backing City, by comparison, would have sounded weak.

Yet City won.

Liverpool, as it happens, played well, though not in the same way as City. The fairest result probably would have been a draw. But Liverpool could have won instead of losing if two shots that hit a post had rebounded differently.

If Liverpool had won I would not have felt able to write this. Because hardly anyone will accept that an action could have been wrong if it turned out right.
What might have seemed like powerful arguments for backing Liverpool, though, were really arguments about something else. Let me explain what I mean.

Imagine that in a match to be played today you can back over 3.5 goals at evens. Is it a good bet?

The question we should consider is this: are four plus goals more likely than not? Answering that question is hard. Without realising, many people will answer an easier question instead. The question they will answer is this: if I had backed four plus goals in the past would I have won more often than not? It is an easier question – and a fundamentally different one.

Suppose that in each of the home team’s last five games there were over 3.5 goals, and that in each of the away team’s last five games there were over 3.5 goals. That might sound like a good reason for backing over 3.5 goals today but it is not. All it does is establish that over 3.5 goals is a bet that would have won in several games that have already been played.

Ask somebody a hard question and unconsciously they will be tempted to answer an easier question instead. Psychologists call this phenomenon substitution. Many football bettors know a lot about substitutes without knowing anything about substitutions. And they are poorer for it.

Premier League standings

To judge whether over 3.5 goals is a good bet today we need some knowledge of how the present emerges from the past.

Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Hinduism recognise that life is a process. You are born, grow, wither and die. While you are alive you are always moving on. There are hardly any cells in your body today that were there ten years ago. So in what sense can anyone say they are the same person they were ten years ago?Three out of every four people who bet on Manchester City v Liverpool with Ladbrokes backed Liverpool.

I am already slightly different than I was yesterday. So is a football team, which is composed of 11 players plus substitutes, manager, coaches and support staff.

Change is inevitable. Usually it is gradual but sometimes it is abrupt. And this is what I have learned about it after watching it in myself and others for many years. No matter how often somebody has done something before, they are nearly always less likely to do it again now than almost everybody else realises.

The present is not a replica of the past
Journalists like to speak about the here and now. They want to sound bang up-to-date. This can be a good thing – as long as it is not misleading. Sometimes it is. From sports writers and broadcasters in particular.

Consider these statements. The team are in form. They play better in the second half. Most of their goals come in the last 15 minutes.

Those statements imply that those things will happen again today. The team will play well, even better in the second half than in the first, and – let us mix in a nice sports journalism cliché – to put the icing on the cake they will score most of their goals in the last 15 minutes.

All of those statements sound good. The only thing wrong with them is that they might not be true. Nobody knows what will happen today.

Now consider these statements. The team have been in form. They have played better in the second half. They have scored most of their goals in the last 15 minutes.
Each statement in this set sounds duller than its counterpart in the previous set. None of them sparkles. Only one good thing can be said about them: they are unquestionably true. They tell us what happened before but make no claim about what will happen next. That should be regarded as a really good thing but it rarely is.

How often do pundits, commentators and reporters imply that something will happen and it does not? One of the commonest reasons they make these mistakes is that they speak as though something that did exist still does exist – when the most that they should say is it may or may not still exist.

As the 18th century philosopher David Hume explained in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, proof that something has happened before is not proof that it will happen again now. Do not equate the past with the present.
